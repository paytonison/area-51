# Ouroboros iteration — with inline footnotes

**1) ≤30-word summary of Electra’s last reply**  
Electra corrected “neptuniumium” to **neptunium**, explained its discovery and provenance, and answered the original question succinctly while flagging possible misnaming.¹citeturn0search1

**2) Two possible factual errors (brief)**  
• Claim: *“Neptuniumium” is the standard name* — incorrect; the accepted name is **neptunium** (element 93).¹citeturn0search1turn0search14  
• Claim: *Discovery year or discoverer misattributed* — common confusion: neptunium was first isolated by Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson in **1940**.²citeturn0search0turn0search7

**3) One concise improvement to the prompt to reduce hallucination**  
Add a short instruction: **“When making factual claims, include numbered footnotes with links to primary or authoritative sources (e.g., peer-reviewed papers, Britannica, official docs).”** This reduces ambiguity and forces source-checking, which is recommended in prompt-engineering guidance.³citeturn0search2turn0search4

**4) Revised prompt (ready to copy/paste)**  
> Ouroboros iteration: Summarize Electra’s last reply in ≤30 words. List 2 possible factual errors. Propose 1 concise improvement to the prompt to reduce hallucination. Then produce the revised prompt. **Important:** when answering, include numbered footnotes for any factual claim and provide clickable links to authoritative sources (Wikipedia, Britannica, original papers, or official docs). Finally, re-run the revised prompt as Electra and **cite sources inline** for load-bearing facts.

**5) Re-run (Electra) — output produced under the revised prompt**

**Electra (re-run):**  
Summary (≤30 words): Corrected “neptuniumium” to **neptunium**, explained its 1940 isolation by McMillan & Abelson, and answered the original question while noting ambiguous naming.¹citeturn0search0turn0search1

Possible factual errors:  
1. The word “neptuniumium” — not the accepted name; the element is **neptunium (Np)**.¹citeturn0search1  
2. If a different discovery date or discoverer was claimed, that’s likely incorrect — **McMillan & Abelson, 1940** is the standard reference.²citeturn0search0turn0search7

Concise prompt improvement to reduce hallucination:  
“Require numbered footnotes pointing to authoritative sources for all factual assertions; prefer primary sources or established references (Britannica, PubChem, IUPAC).”³citeturn0search2turn0search8

Revised prompt (Electra used this):  
> See section 4 above. (Electra followed the instruction to include footnotes.)

Answer to the original question (Electra’s reply, abbreviated):  
If you meant **neptunium** (element 93), it was first synthesized and identified at Berkeley in 1940 by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson; the element was named after the planet Neptune (following uranium → Uranus → Neptune naming logic). For primary reading: McMillan & Abelson’s reports and authoritative summaries (Britannica, NPS, RSC) are good starting points.¹citeturn0search0turn0search7turn0search5
